### Xiphias: Using A Multi-Dimensional Approach Towards Creating Meaningful-Gamification-Based Badge Mechanics

Grant giving body: University Research Council, Ateneo de Manila University  
Grant Total: ₱487,500.00  
January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.  

The main objective of the study is to design, create and test a few novel Meaningful -Gamification-based badges through a multi-dimensional approach where the badge mechanics are based on three constructs namely, (1) Clear’s Behavior Change Model of Clear, (2) Hari’s Lost Connections Model and (3) Peterson et. al’s Five Factors Model.
